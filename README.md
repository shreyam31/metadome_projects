# Chapter 7 - Project 1

  The code is written in pure JavaScript and can be run on any online editor directly.

  The goal is to build robots that deliver parcels around a village. We are comparing two robots based on the number of moves they make for a 100 tasks. 
  
  In the next task, a persistent group class is created with the methods add, has and delete. This lass works for values of any type.

  Thank you.
